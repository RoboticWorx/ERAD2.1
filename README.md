# ERAD2.1
**ERAD2.1 is an improved version of [ERAD2](https://github.com/RoboticWorx/ERAD2)**, adding encoder support to make it an even better next-gen, open-source, wireless BLDC motor driver. It's based around the powerful TMC6200 gate driver and an ESP32-S3 MCU with built-in hardware support for Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, ESP-NOW, hall effect sensors, **and now an AS5048A encoder as well**. This makes it a versatile BLDC motor driver compatible with any project! Simply send commands from wherever, and have ERAD2.1 execute the movements with the easy-to-use Arduino library [SimpleFOC](https://simplefoc.com/).

The all-inclusive, open-source article explaining the **original ERAD2 project** and how it works [can be found here for free](https://roboticworx.io/blogs/projects/erad2).

***NOTE:** If you want to use any print commands, make sure "USB CDC On Boot" is enabled.*
